# Psychic-Game
HW #3

This is meant to be a simple guessing game app. The user can type keys to guess what letter the computer
has selected. This is also something of a placeholder, since its not portfolio-worthy.

I have created this to complete the homework assignment and fill a spot on my portfolio, until
I complete my Hangman Game. When that is complete this app will be removed and the Hangman Game will be linked.

This feels like its 100% mine, warts and all. The Hangman game was starting to just look like a copy of
a lot of other people's javascript, albeit with my own original theme.
I will reattempt to code the Hangman Game when I have a better grasp on JS.

*****I had some trouble finishing the end game function so that a new game could be started. Refreshing the browser always works!
